# Problem Statement:
- Understanding and analyzing customer sentiment from reviews is crucial for businesses like McDonald's to enhance customer satisfaction and brand image. With a vast dataset of over 33,000 customer reviews, there's a need to effectively preprocess and analyze this data to derive actionable insights.

# Dataset:
- The dataset comprises over 33,000 customer reviews of McDonaldâ€™s stores across the United States.


#Techniques:
- Rigorous Data Cleaning Techniques:
    - Employed thorough data cleaning methods to ensure the quality and integrity of the dataset.
- NLTK Preprocessing:
    - Utilized NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for effective preprocessing of the textual data, including tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.
- Advanced Natural Language Processing Methodologies:
    - Leveraged state-of-the-art techniques such as VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to accurately measure sentiment intensity.
- Knowledge Graph Visualization:
    - Implemented knowledge graph visualization to unveil intricate relationships embedded within the reviews, providing deeper insights into customer sentiments.
- Topic Modeling Algorithms:
    - Applied topic modeling algorithms, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to extract underlying themes from the reviews, facilitating a better understanding of customer preferences and concerns.


# Hypothesis:
- The hypothesis tested whether negative sentiment scores in McDonald's customer reviews significantly differed between 1-star ratings and 2-star ratings and above, aiming to ascertain the impact of sentiment on star ratings for informed decision-making processes.

# Approaches:

- Sentiment Intensity Measurement:
    - Utilized VADER and BERT to measure sentiment intensity, allowing for a nuanced understanding of customer sentiments.
- Topic Extraction:
    - Employed LDA to extract underlying themes from the reviews, enabling the identification of key topics driving customer sentiment.
- Hypothesis Testing:
    - Tested hypotheses to validate findings, with a focus on the significance of negative sentiment scores in relation to star ratings.

# Conclusion:
- The project successfully conducted sentiment analysis on a vast dataset of McDonald's customer reviews. By employing rigorous data cleaning techniques, advanced natural language processing methodologies, and topic modeling algorithms, actionable insights were derived to enhance customer satisfaction and fortify the McDonald's brand image. Additionally, hypothesis testing affirmed the significance of negative sentiment scores, contributing to informed decision-making processes aimed at improving customer experience.
